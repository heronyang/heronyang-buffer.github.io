# Reading Note - Debugging Teams

I read the book - [Debugging Teams: Better Productivity through
Collaboration](https://www.amazon.com/Debugging-Teams-Productivity-through-Collaboration/dp/1491932058)
recently to learn more about collaborations. This post contains the
sentences from the book that I found helpful for myself and the future me. I subjectively divided
the sentences into two sets - the very important ones, and other important ones.

## Important Sentences

- HRT (important):
  - Humility: You are not the center of the universe. You're neither omnisciennt
      nor infallible. You're open to self-improvement.
  - Respect: You genuinely care about others you work with. You treat them as
      human beings, and appreciate their abilities and accomplishments.
  - Trust: You believe others are competent and will do the right thing, and
      you're okay with letting them drive when appropriate.
- Give people: "autonomy", "mastery", and "purpose".
- "Track happiness" - ask "what do you need?"
- "Failure is an option." - If you're not failing now and then, you're not being
    innovative enough or taking enough risks.
- The more you are open to influence, the more you are able to influence; the
    more vulnerable you are, the stronger you appear.
- Even if you're great at writing code, there's still an upper limit to the
    amount of code you can write. Seek to replace yourself.
- "Do the right thing, wait to get fired." (Chade-Meng Tan, Googler) If I don't
    get fired, I've done the Right Thing for everyone. If I do get fired, this
    is the wrong employer to work for in the first place. So, either way, I win.
    That is my career strategy.
- At some point, you need to decide when it's time to cut your losses and move
    on.

## More Sentences

- Mission: more time creating and less time fighting - by improving their
    ability to collaborate with other people.
- 'hide my code' is caused by insecurity - people are afraid of others seeing
    and judging their work in progress. Hiding is considered harmful - how do
    you even know if you're on the right track?
- 'bus factor' is the number of people that need to get hit by a bus before your
    project is completedly doomed.
- Linus's real achievement was to lead these people and coordinate their work.
- Working alone is inherently riskier than working with others.
- It's not about tracking or manipulating people; it's about creating
    relationships to get things done, and relationships always outlast projects.
- Nobody wants to work with someone who consistently behaves like he's the most
    important person in the room.
- Rather than worrying about whether you're personally awesome, try to build a
    sense of team accomplishment and group pride.
- Once you reach a local maximum on your team, you stop learning. And when you
    stop learning, you get bored.
- If you don't put effort into building and maintaining your culture, your team
    will eventually be overtaken by strong personalities that cultivate their
    culture in your team. If you build a strongly defined one, it will become
    self-selecting.
- As your project progresses, the mission statement keeps things on track.
- Try to schedule the meeting near other interrupt points in your day.
- Traditional managers worry about how to get things done, while leaders worry
    about what things get done .. (and trust their team to figure out how to do
    it.)
- "A people hire other A people; B people hire C people."
- Leader is always on stage.
- In many cases, knowing the right person is more valuable than knowing the
    right answer.
- One of the hardest things to do as a team leader is to watch a more
    junior-level team member spend three hours working on something you know you
    can knock out in 20 minutes.
- Being sensitive to personal situations that your team mebers are going through
    can give you a lot of insight into why they may be more or less productive
    at any given time.
- Let your team know when they're doing well.
- Focus on the long term: Do you truly believe the project will still benefit in
    the long run? Do you believe the conflict will ultimately resolve itself in
    a useful way?
- When you fail, take responsiblity, don't seek to assign blame, and document
    what happened and what you can do to avoid that same failure again.
- Bad manager sees your existence solely as a means to get herself promoted, and
    she doesn't care about your career, much less your team's happiness.
- Is your manager serving you? Or are you seving your manager? It should always
    be the former.
- You need to try to ensure that both your manager and the people outside your
    team are not only aware of what you're doing, but are aware that you're
    doing it well.
- Avoid promising things that you can't deliver, even if it means saying "no"
    more often than you'd like.
- After years of trial and werror, we've found that shorter emails are even more
    likely to get a response.
- There's probably nothing else you can do. Don't be a victim. Get the heck out
    of there.
- You can't ignore marketing, but you can actively cooperate with marketing.
- "Focus on the user, and all else will follow."
- Measure usage, not users.


## My Takeaway

I like the book focuses on HRT (Humility, Respect, Trust) as the key factors in
collaborations. The book also points out things that are easily be missed out, e.g.
always track happiness. I am afraid that I will forget immportant things
learned from this book over time, so I put them into this post for myself and
the future me.
